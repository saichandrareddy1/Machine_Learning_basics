Hello Machine Freaks!

I going to discuss about The Basic Machine Learning algorithms

============SVM=============
1. SUPPORT VECTOR Classifier
SVM uses for the classification of the data  
2. SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION 
SVR used for the prediction of the feature data (Regression)

Difference Between the Classification and Regression

===========================================CLASSIFICATION===========================
1.classification means the classes it will have the calsses in the data like(male, female, 0,1)
2.classicification says about the accuracy of the data in metrices
3.Classification have confusion matrix
4.classification for only separete the data into different classes

==========================================Regression================================
1.Regression means the presicting the future data like(StockMarket prediction, House rate, etc...)
2.Regression says about error in the data
